                    <h2>‚ò¢Ô∏è What is radiation, and how are we exposed to it in our world?</h2>
                    <p>Radiation is energy that travels through space or materials. We encounter natural sources like cosmic rays and radon gas, as well as artificial sources like X-rays and nuclear power.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è What are the health risks of exposure to ionizing radiation?</h2>
                    <p>Exposure effects depend on dose and duration. Low doses (medical imaging) are safe, while high doses can cause radiation sickness or increase cancer risk.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>üõ°Ô∏è How can individuals protect themselves from radiation at work and in daily life?</h2>
                    <p>Follow the **time, distance, and shielding** principles:  
                        Minimize exposure time,  
                        Increase distance from sources,  
                        Use protective barriers like lead walls or clothing.</p>

                    <h2>üìè What are the safe radiation exposure limits for humans?</h2>
                    <p>Regulations set by the **ICRP & NRC**:  
                        Workers: **50 mSv/year**,  
                        Public: **1 mSv/year**,  
                        Emergency exposure may be higher but must be controlled.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>üö® What should someone do in case of a radiation emergency or accidental exposure?</h2>
                    <p>**Stay calm & act fast:**  
                        Move away from the source,  
                        Remove contaminated clothing,  
                        Wash exposed skin,  
                        Use radiation detectors to check exposure,  
                        Seek medical attention if necessary.</p>

                    <h2>üì° What are radiation dosimetry and monitoring, and how do they work?</h2>
                    <p>Dosimetry measures radiation exposure using:  
                        **Personal dosimeters** (TLDs, film badges),  
                        **Workplace monitoring**,  
                        **Biological dosimetry** (after high exposures).</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>üî¨ What is the difference between ionizing and non-ionizing radiation?</h2>
                    <p>**Ionizing radiation** (X-rays, gamma rays) can damage cells and DNA.  
                        **Non-ionizing radiation** (radio waves, microwaves) is generally safe but can cause heat effects.</p>
