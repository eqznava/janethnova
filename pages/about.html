        <h2>Radiation Protection in Nuclear Power Plants</h2>
        <p>
            Radiation protection is a fundamental pillar in the safe operation of nuclear power plants. Its primary goal is to minimize radiation exposure for workers, the public, and the environment, following the 
            <strong>ALARA</strong> principle (<em>As Low As Reasonably Achievable</em>).
        </p>
        <p>
            On this platform, you will find key information about radiation protection principles, international regulations, radiation monitoring, and best practices used in the nuclear industry to ensure safety.
